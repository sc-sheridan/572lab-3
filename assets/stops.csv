1,Geology Museum,43.07034724,-89.40600791,"The UW Madison Geology Museum has a long history that predates Weeks Hall of Geological Science. It began in 1877 in Science Hall. Ironically the geology department was established a whole year later! The Geology Museum left Science Hall after 88 years. The curator mentioned that ""the first museum director wanted to stay in Science Hall. The beauty and history of the building is incomparable. But, sadly we needed to expand."" The Geology Museum continues to grow its collection to this day with recent additions including a <a href= 'https://news.wisc.edu/exceptional-meteorite-plowed-up-from-a-dane-county-field-finds-new-home-in-uw-geology-museum/'> meteorite </a> older than the Earth itself! Experience the museum: it has pieces of history that you can touch and even a tunnel you can enter to experience what being in a cave is like. Feel free to explore the museum before going on to the next stop!",Begin your tour by going to the Geology Museum located in the back left corner of Weeks Hall of Geological Science,stop1.png
2,Boaz Mastodon Fossil,43.07026282,-89.40600281,"The Boaz mastodon has been one of the main attractions of the Geology Museum since its donation. It was discovered in a muddy stream by four boys in 1897 near Richland Center, WI and donated by the family soon after. The Boaz mastodon skeleton was once considered to be a complete specimen. However, a researcher found that the skeleton is actually made of bones of two mastodons: the Boaz mastodon and the Anderson Mills mastodon. Here is an image with which bones belong to the different mastodons. Try to find the bones from each mastodon! <img id='stop-img' src='../img/mast_bones2.png'>",Head into the Geology Museum and take the left path to see the fossils,stop2.png
3,Geologic Stained Glass,43.07041803,-89.40589499,"Here is one of the most prominent features of Weeks Geology Hall: the stained glass window! This window depicts faults moving beds of folded rocks. It was designed by UW Madison alum Paul Dombrowski in 1982 during the second renovation of the building. The museum director said that Paul designed the window to ""envision the dynamic nature of the layers of the earth"". This is one of the few outward facing windows as the architects wanted to avoid the ""unattractive and industrial"" view. You can take the elevator to the second floor and get a good view of the stained glass from the walkway up there.",Stepping out of the Geology Museum you will see the stained glass window to your right,stop3.png
4,Ancient Ripple Marks,43.07046436,-89.40604837,Ripple marks are made in ancient oceans when waves moved gently over a sandy tidal flat. Over time these marks are preserved and often they contain signs of ancient life. The top slab of ripple marks has small animal tracks that criss-cross the entire piece. The bottom right piece of ripples has fossilized jellyfish impressions. The bottom left piece has tracks left by arthropods (early crustaceans). Many of these pieces were preserved through efforts by the Geology department. In 2010 a group of geology professors protected Point of Rocks from the threat of highway expansion by making it a Wisconsin Historical Site. Point of Rocks contains some of the largest pieces of preserved ripple marks in all of Wisconsin. Little pieces of those ripples now hang on this wall alongside the ones pictured here. ,A short distance away a wall with ripple marks is to your left,stop4.png
5,Courtyard Garden,43.070674,-89.40618314,Welcome to the courtyard! You may have walked through it to get to the main entrance of Weeks Hall but let's take a closer look at it.  There are 81 rocks scattered throughout the garden (including 3 in the fountain). In the middle of the garden there is a sign with the rock names and where they were collected. Each of these rocks is very unique and they are often pieces that professors have personally collected. Feel free to touch or even stand on any of the rocks! Pictured below are an example of two rocks in the garden (number 38 and 77). They are pieces of Archean migmatite and Coal-bed clinker. <img id='stop-img' src='../img/stop5_extra.png'>,Leave Weeks Hall from the main entrance and you will enter the courtyard,stop5.png
6,Rock Pit,43.07043247,-89.40656406,"Congratulations, this is the end of the tour! Now you are at what geology students call ""the Rock Pit"". Often graduate students or professors put rocks that they need to get rid of in this pit. The rocks range from sandstone to rocks with small pieces of garnet. Any of these rocks are free to take home, so take as many as you want! Just use caution because there are sharp rocks in there so please don't get cut. Here is just one of the many rocks that are in the Rock Pit:  <img id='stop-img' src='../img/my_rock.png'>",Face Dayton street and then turn left. A little past the Atmospheric Building there are stairs. Head down those then turn left into the back parking lot of Weeks Hall,stop6.png
